*Where this snippet can be found*: <feature>-search.selectors.ts :
[subs=+macros]
----
export const selectResults = createSelector(
  <%= featurePropertyName %>SearchSelectors.selectResults,
  (results): RowListGridData[] => {
    return results.map((item) => ({
      id: item.<%= featurePropertyName %>.id,
      imagePath: '',
      ...item,

          .keyof()
          .options.map((k) => [k, null])
      ) as Record<keyof <%= featureClassName %>SearchCriteria, unknown>,

=== ACTION S8: Add additional properties here

* The <FeatureName>SearchResult data structure in the BFF yaml must be adapted. 

** All the data that should be displayed in the results must be in that data structure either on top-level or in sub data structures. 

** The data should be as minimal as possible to not create to much load to the backend and DB. 

**  The parameters of the search endpoint in the BFF yaml must be adapted

*Where this snippet can be found*: <feature>-bff.yaml. :

----
Search<Feature>Request:
      type: object
      properties:
        limit:
          type: integer
          maximum: 2500
        id:
          type: integer
          format: int64
        # ACTION S8: add additional properties here
----
Here you can add additional properties which you need for your <SearchFeatureRequest> / <SearchFeatureResult>, e.g. status, creationDate ...
